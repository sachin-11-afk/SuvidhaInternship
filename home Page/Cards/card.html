                My son has been fighting for his life since he was a 5-year-old.
                Now years later, he is still fighting. However, the cancer seems
                to take more and more control of his body I can’t help but
                think, will God spare my child this time or will cancer actually
                take him away from me? What goes on in a mother’s mind when any
                time she visits the hospital with her son, she is informed that
                his cancer has relapsed? Having faced that situation thrice, I
                pray to God none of the parents ever have the ill fortune to
                witness their own child suffering from cancer from time and
                again. My family's happiness lies in Abir. Him being the
                youngest member of my family of four, all of us are accustomed
                to his joyous and playful. When he became extremely sick the
                first time, he was scared and sad. Yet he tried to cheer all of
                us up as much as he could. 2014-2017 In April 2014, I was given
                the worst news any mother could receive. It was the first time
                Abir was diagnosed with Leukemia. Abir was in and out of
                hospital stays for three long years. He spent much of his early
                childhood getting poked by needles, giving blood, sleeping in
                hospital beds and receiving harsh chemotherapy. He not only lost
                all his hair, his body weight also decreased drastically.
                Finally, in June 2017, I finally received news my heart was
                aching to hear. After 3 years of painful treatments, Abir had
                finally beat cancer. He could finally live his life like a
                normal child. However, fate had other plans.
